# Survivor-Island-of-Lost-Souls
With the Survivor 41 being pushed to 2021 due to COVID-19, here's a program I've been tinkering with for a possible Survivor season idea that I've been tinkering with for the past few months. You can use it to make your own fictional Survivor seasons. (Note: Takes a while and there are still a few kinks that I need to work out, but I hope you enjoy!)
Please be specific when it comes to answering the input sections during play. For instance, writing yes or no specifically in lower case for yes/no type questions. Or writing the name as intended when you first write it.
Ex 1: Typing "NO" rather than "no" for the question, "Would anyone like to give up their vote for a token?" would cause an error.
Ex 2: Writing jimmy later on for a thing such as willing tokens if you initially wrote the contestant's name as Jimmy will cause an error.
So please, be specific with your spelling and your capitalization, otherwise these errors can get very irritating.
I will frequently update this program as often as I can to make it more efficient and fun.
Also, feel free to comment or message me or however you want any issues that you get so I can look into them. Thank you and enjoy!
